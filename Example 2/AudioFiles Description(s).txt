The 2 code files included were created as part of a VR Game made at University.

The files serve similar purposes, both handling the playing of audio files for immersion purposes.

The file "WalkingSounds" handles the general footstep sounds of the player walking around, playing a different sound depending on what surface the player is walking on, as well as playing no sound if the players position isn't changing.

The file "InBushes" very simply handles playing additional audio when the player is colliding with a bush object.

Both files operate relatively simplistically however achieve a great result for immersing the player.

I currently do not own a VR headset, so the recording included is from an FPS rig, recorded on my laptop.
